// Use Javascript modules to create seperate files for each of the Leave type classes.
// - Comment your understanding about import
/**The import declaration is used to import read-only live bindings which are exported by another module. 
The imported bindings are called live bindings because they are updated by the module that exported the binding, but cannot be re-assigned by the importing module.
In order to use the import declaration in a source file, the file must be interpreted by the runtime as a module. 
In HTML, this is done by adding type="module" to the <script> tag. Modules are automatically interpreted in strict mode.**/

// - Comment your understanding about export
/**The export declaration is used to export values from a JavaScript module. 
 * Exported values can then be imported into other programs with the import declaration or dynamic import. 
 * The value of an imported binding is subject to change in the module that exports it â€” when a module updates the value of a binding that it exports, 
 * the update will be visible in its imported value. */
